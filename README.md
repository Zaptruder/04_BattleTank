# Battle Tank Game Design Document 

## 1	Core Concept
-	The player drives around a tank and engages in combat with an opposing tank.
-	The player is challenged to grasp tank controls, navigate the terrain and make strategic moves to out play the opposing tank.
-	The player will be alerted to the state of the tank via a HUD – presenting player with information such as damage, ammo, heading, etc.

## 2	Rules
-	Player can move anywhere within the terrain, which is surrounded by impassable mountains (boxed in)
-	Tanks start with finite health and ammo
-	The player starts with a tank, and faces off against enemy tanks.
-	The player wins when the opposing tanks have been destroyed.
-	The player loses when they’ve suffered too much damage and their tank is destroyed.
-	The player can be assisted with power ups scattered throughout the terrain.
-	Tanks takes locational damage, which can reduce armor on sections independently, but also cause different status effects as equipment malfunctions or is destroyed.

## 3	Requirements

-	C++ code and blueprint to encode behavior – as best suits.
-	SFX: Gun firing, explosion, barrel moving, turret moving, engine sound.
-	Static Mesh: Simple tank comprising tracks, body, turret and barrel.
